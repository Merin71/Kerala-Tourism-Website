           <p style="font-size:smaller;"> Palakkad also known as Palghat, historically known as Palakkattussery, is a city and municipality in the Indian state of Kerala. 
            It is the administrative headquarters of the Palakkad District. 
            Palakkad is most densely populated municipality and fourth-most densely populated city as well as the biggest district of Kerala. 
            It was established before Indian independence under British rule and known by the name Palghat. 
            Palakkad is famous for the ancient Palakkad Fort, which is in the heart of the city and was captured and rebuilt by Hyder Ali in 1766 which later fell into the hands of Zamorin in 1784 . 
            The city is about 347 kilometres (216 mi) northeast of the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram.The 18th-century Palakkad Fort has sturdy battlements, a moat, and a Hanuman temple on its grounds. 
            North on the Kalpathy River, the 15th-century Viswanatha Swamy Temple is the main venue of the Ratholsavam chariot festival. 
            The river Bharathappuzha flows through Palakkad. Palakkad is on the northern bank of Bharathappuzha River. 
            Palakkad was included in the South Malabar region of Malabar District during the British Raj. 
            The municipality of Palakkad was formed on 1 November 1866 according to the Madras Act 10 of 1865 (Amendment of the Improvements in Towns act 1850) of the British Indian Empire, along with the municipalities of Kozhikode, Kannur, Thalassery, and Fort Kochi, making them Kerala's oldest modern municipalities.
